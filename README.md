Created a banking system using OOPs. 
Where we can Deposit and Withdraw the amount and can see the details of the user.
User will enter the amount he/she want to Deposit or Withdraw.
Two methods are used to restart the code by taking input from user. i.e. 
1.  while loop 
2.  With the help of a function.
